This project was born when I came too early at my work building. We are a small startup on Vale do SÃ£o Francisco, Brazil.

The objective of this project is provide an API with authentication and authorization for users to login into a home automation server that can, for now, open a electronic lock.

# Instructions

This project uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as database through the [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) library.

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Update the variables to correspond your environment.

Generate the RSA keys:

```bash
npm run key:generate
```

or

```bash
node keys.js
```

-----

### SETUP

Run docker

```bash
docker-compose up # verify first you are in sudo group.
```

If you see this error when to execute node container:
```bash
Internal watch failed: ENOSPC: System limit for number of file watchers reached, watch '/home/node/app/README.md'
```
execute this to fix it:
```bash
sudo sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches=582222 && sudo sysctl -p
```

Create the super user

```bash
docker-compose exec node node initDatabase.js
```

This project doesn't have a front-end, yet.
